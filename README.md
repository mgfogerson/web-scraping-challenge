# web-scraping-challenge

This is my final product for the web-scraping/MongoDB homework challenge. For this challenge, I created a Python app in Flask that opened an HTML template, which ran a scrape function referenced in another Python script. The information was scraped with BeautifulSoup using Splinter, which allowed non-static files  to be captured and retrieved, such as news headlines. Information of several types was stored in the Mongo component of the project, highlighting its use for heterogeneous data sets. URL strings, a list of dictionaries and an HTML table component were added to the same MongoDB. The HTML table gave me trouble to load into the page, so I just printed the table in my notebook and copy/pasted it manually, also allowing me to trim the numbered headers and style the appearance. The final product is a lightly CSS-styled webpage with retrieved headlines, images retrieved from a Mongo-stored list of dictionaries, and a table scraped from online using Pandas.
